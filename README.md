# AuthenticationSystem
A simple authentication system developed in Node.js using the Nest.js framework. This system provides features such as user account creation, login, token generation, and token renewal. It uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and Prisma as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database operations.
